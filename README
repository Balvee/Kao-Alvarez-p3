## Unix Utility Collection
## Brian Alvarez


Project 3 consists of a collection of 13 basic Unix utilities that we have implemented
using low-level system calls.


## Instructions on how to run the Project 3 programs:

To remove any previous versions of the programs, type in:

$ make clean

To compile all the programs at once, type in:

$ make

Or you can compile specific programs by typing:

$ make (name of program you want to make)

From here, you can run the program by typing the name of the program like so:

$ ./cal
